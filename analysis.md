# Analysis

## Overview

The analysis has two entry points in the `analysis/` folder:

1. **`_build-estimation-data.r`**: Loads raw data from `data/output/`, merges, constructs all variables (financial, capacity, event indicators), applies winsorization and interpolation, computes IPW weights, and writes `est.dat` and `state.dat` CSVs to `data/output/`. Also sources `1-sum-stats.R` for summary statistics. Run this when underlying data inputs change.

2. **`_run-analysis.r`**: Reads saved CSVs, sets global parameters, builds three stacked datasets, and sequentially sources estimation scripts. Does not rebuild the data.

## Estimation Design

The core approach is **stacked difference-in-differences** to handle heterogeneous treatment timing. Treatment is CAH designation at the hospital level, with state-level program availability as the policy instrument.

Three stacking functions in `functions.R`:
- `stack_hosp()` — Hospital-level, controls from never-treated and not-yet-treated states
- `stack_hosp_elig()` — Hospital-level, controls are all non-CAH or not-yet-CAH hospitals (no state restriction)
- `stack_state()` — State-level, collapses to state-year counts

Primary estimators: Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) and Callaway-Sant'Anna (CS).
